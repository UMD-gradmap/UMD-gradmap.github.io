# Physics and Astronomy Bridge Programs

In recent years, the fields of astronomy and physics have seen a growth in the number of post-baccalaureate programs for students in between undergraduate and graduate programs. Bridge programs vary in the details from school to school, but they all have similar goals: provide the experience, support, and preparation for students who might otherwise not be able to get in to Ph.D. programs in Physics/Astronomy. They tend to specifically target underrepresented minorities, but are open to any student who could benefit from the program. The programs generally all feature:

* Full funding (tuition paid, full-year stipend)
* Participation in research
* Coursework (graduate and/or advanced undergraduate)
* Professional development, GRE prep, career/graduate admissions advicea and guidance
* One-on-one mentoring

Further benefits (e.g. granting of a Master's degree or a fast-track into a Ph.D. program) and requirements (e.g., citizenship) vary from school to school, so please read the websites linked below for details.
